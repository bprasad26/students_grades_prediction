### Project Description - 

The goal of the project is to predict the performance of students grades and understand what features are most important for predicting the grades. Understanding this will help
teachers, students and their parents to improve their child performance. We all want our childs to do better in life but it is not always clear what to do. Understanding the features that have the most impact on childs peformance will remove the guess work and help everyone to achieve the task much faster and better. 

To have a good model, real world data about students grades, demographic, social and school
related features was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Data Descriptions can be found inside the data folder in a text file.
